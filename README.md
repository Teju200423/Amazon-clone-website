# Amazon-clone-website
This project is a front-page clone of Amazon, developed as a part of a mini-project to explore web development fundamentals. The design replicates the structure and layout of Amazon’s homepage, giving a hands-on experience in building modern, responsive web pages.

Features Implemented:

Navigation Bar: Includes search bar, category options, and sign-in/cart placeholders.

Hero Section: Large banner image representing ongoing offers or promotions.

Product Sections: Grid-based layout displaying products in categories, similar to Amazon’s homepage.

Footer Section: Contains useful links, information, and basic page styling.

Learning Outcomes:

Through this project, I learned and practiced:

HTML for webpage structure.

CSS for styling, layout, and responsiveness.

Basics of aligning content using flexbox/grid.

Building a professional-looking landing page inspired by a real-world website.
